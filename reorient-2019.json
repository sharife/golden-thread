The line-up includes playwrights with longtime association with Golden Thread: Egyptian-American playwright Yussef El Guindi, Bay Area-based Palestinian-American playwright Betty Shamieh, and MacArthur Fellow and celebrated playwright Naomi Wallace. Joining these writers are four newcomers to the festival: Iraqi-British writer and actor Rendah Heywood, Noor Theatre Founding Artistic Director Lameece Issaq, Turkish-Kurdish writer and filmmaker Mustafa Kaymak, and local Iranian-American writer Niku Sharei. Selected from 108 submissions from 13 countries, the seven short plays are diverse in content and style, highlighting the multiplicity of Middle Eastern perspectives and identities.\n\n“Humanity is at the core of ReOrient. **If theatre is community, it starts here.** If the goal of theatre is to expand our viewpoint, to enrich our knowledge, and to embrace empathy, then ReOrient hugely succeeds.” _—Stark Insider_","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/productions/reorient-2019.md","sha":"7ac775c199efdf314959d005891101fe5d6f4e00"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-08-29T22:55:25.459Z"}
