Since its launch in 2011, many New Threads plays and playwrights have continued on to receive mainstage productions.\n\nThe readings are accompanied by talkbacks with the artists and experts that comment on the themes of the play. We invite you to join the creative process of a new play and discover brilliant gems never before seen in the Bay Area. We invite you to laugh, cry, and think alongside these beautiful stories from and about the Middle East. Each play is teeming with unexpected humor, surprising characters, and important questions about the world we live in today.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/productions/new-threads-reading-series.md","sha":"766465bbb03b78c3a323d84a7900e61ea9d4833b"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-11-26T23:28:12.828Z"}
