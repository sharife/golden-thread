  A fearless eight-year old businessman makes his living directing traffic with a soda bottle on the highway connecting Jalalabad to Kabul. Soldiers, accidents, and ghosts are no match for this little fighter with a knack for surviving the toughest challenges. Inspired by a [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/world/asia/afghan-boys-eke-living-amid-peril-at-gorge.html?_r=1) article about the real-life “Pepsi bottle boys” of Afghanistan, this poetic play introduces an up-and-coming writer of great promise.<br /><br />Kevin Artigue is a graduate of Public Theater’s prestigious Emerging Writers Group and the first playwright of non-Middle Eastern descent to be produced on the Golden Thread mainstage. He has been developing this play with Golden Thread for three years, including as part of the 2014 National New Play Network’s showcase.

        Kiran Patel attends San Francisco Friends School, where he has been an avid member of the theatre community. Kiran’s role in his school’s fourth grade production of <em>Hangtown</em> gave birth to his love and passion for acting. While in the fifth grade, Kiran played a lead comedic role in an after­school production about capitalism called <em>Corn Cobbers</em>, loosely based on Animal Farm. During the past summer, Kiran attended acting camp at the A.C.T. to further refine his skills. This fall, as a seventh grader, Kiran is in two plays: <em>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</em> and <em>Little Women</em>. His versatility is shown through the drastic differences in the demeanors of his characters. Puck is a playful and mischievous elf, while Brooke is a serious and level­headed tutor.
