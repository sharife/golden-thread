  **Hanane Hajj Ali**, a fifty-something Lebanese actress and citizen, exercises
  daily to avoid osteoporosis, obesity, and depression. As she jogs through both
  secluded and open spaces in Beirut, she revisits dreams, desires, hopes,
  disillusionments, characters, and roles. Her body is stimulated through
  exercise with two hormones, dopamine and adrenaline, alternating between
  destruction and construction. In Medea-like fashion, this cycle within Hanane
  — woman, wife and mother — echoes that of her city, one that destroys to build
  and builds to destroy.

# Reviews

“Gloriously unpredictable and compelling.… a radical challenge to the stereotypes and prejudices that afflict global perceptions of Arab women.” Cat Acheson, _The Skinny_

“And yet to call Jogging a play about running would be like calling The Odyssey a story about sailing. As with Ali’s layers of scarves and hair, the deceptively straightforward premise unfolds itself into proliferating narratives, voices, and histories. It’s a play that meditates on what it is to be a woman, a wife, a mother, a citizen, and an artist.” Katie Logan, _Arablit_
