heading: A West Coast Premiere Play by Yussef El Guindi
description: >-
  Struggling writer Gamal hates the way his fellow Arab-Americans represent
  their culture on American media. It’s easy enough to take out his frustration
  on literature superstar Mohsen and local mosque leader, Sheikh Alfani. But
  when his own girlfriend and novelist Noor gets an offer from a major publisher
  backed with a national media campaign, how will Gamal manage his
  frustration?<br /><br />Award-winning Egyptian-American playwright Yussef El
  Guindi holds the honor of being the most produced writer at Golden Thread. El
  Guindi has won the Steinberg/American Theater Critics Association’s New Play
  Award in 2012, and was the recipient of the 2010 Middle East America
  Distinguished Playwright Award. His previous premieres with the company
  include <em>Language Rooms</em>, <em>Jihad Jones and the Kalashnikov
  Babes</em>, <em>Back of the Throat</em>, <em>Scenic Routes</em>, and many
  shorts in ReOrient Festivals. Golden Thread performed El Guindi’s <em>Karima’s
  City</em> at the Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theatre in
  2004.

## Reviews

<strong>HIGHEST RATING!</strong><br />
&#8220;Smart, daring and well constructed&#8230; For a play about ideas, the kind of urgent ideas that don’t make it to American stages often enough, its debaters are just as complex and fleshed out as the ideas themselves.&#8221; —<em>San Francisco Chronicle</em> <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/performance/article/Enemies-you-want-to-get-close-to-10429039.php#photo-11670558" target="_blank"><strong>(read full review)</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>Powerful, unforgettable theatre</strong>&#8230; There’s sex, deep rumination, harsh conflict, galvanizing anger, violence, manipulation, lying, fierce intelligence, incisive criticism and genuine affection. Director Torange Yeghiazarian and her tremendous actors throw the conversation wide open and invite the audience to be active participants in the drama.&#8221; —<em>Theater Dogs</em> <a href="http://www.theaterdogs.net/2016/11/07/making-friends-with-golden-threads-enemies/" target="_blank"><strong>(read full review)</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>FIVE STARS! El Guindi ‘s command of dramatic construction is superb.</strong> He layers event upon event until the jigsaw puzzle is dramatically complete with more than a soupcon of satirical humor and a dollop of sex.&#8221; —<em>Theatre World</em> <a href="http://forallevents.info/reviews/a-dynamic-our-enemies-lively-scene-of-love-and-combat-lives-up-to-its-title-at-the-thick-house/" target="_blank"><strong>(read full review)</strong></a></p>
<p>&#8220;<strong>A gripping drama</strong>&#8230; <em>Our Enemies</em> exposes the futility of using group affiliation to decide that basic question: Who speaks for me? Who is a “genuine” Arab? A “genuine” Muslim? Or, for that matter, a “genuine” American?
