  Called "extraordinary" by the *San Francisco Chronicle*, *Oh My Sweet Land* returns to Bay Area home and community kitchens after a sold-out pilot run in October 2017. The tour-de-force solo show, based on interviews with Syrian refugees in Jordan, takes an unflinching and personal look at the Syrian refugee crisis, and the brutal war that led up to it. In the play, a woman of mixed Syrian-German parentage recalls her encounter with Ashraf, a Syrian man in Paris, all the while preparing *kibbeh*, a Syrian delicacy. When he disappears, she goes on an arduous journey in search of him that leads to stirring conversations with some of the two-million Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan. One part detective story, one part a woman’s reckoning with her heritage, *Oh My Sweet Land* offers an intimate and nuanced perspective on the conflict in Syria and highlights the resilience of the Syrian people.

          "*Oh My Sweet Land* harks back to a primal joy: that of sitting at the counter of an experienced cook, to watch, listen and smell as she works and tells stories."

          "Suffused with rich sensorial detail, a dollop of mordant humor and an ineffable yearning for home, *Oh My Sweet Land* is about characters, says Yeghiazarian, who are driven by urgency, a need for protection and the need to protect."

Zuabi says of his experience of working on the play: “We met people in the harshest moments of their life, yet still they were generous, full of grace, hope, and even humor. This piece is inspired by their stories but more than anything it is inspired by their spirit — that elastic rubber-like ability man has to adapt and to weather the storm.”

*Oh My Sweet Land* runs one hour followed by a 30-minute food sharing and community conversation. Instead of a traditional theater space, _Oh My Sweet Land_ will be performed in kitchens around the Bay Area with performances followed by food sharing and community conversations. The performance includes the cooking of meat, onions, wheat, and spices. Some locations may not be accessible for those with disabilities or allergens may be present. Please see individual performance dates for pricing and more details.
