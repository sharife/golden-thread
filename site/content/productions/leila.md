          "Golden Thread has quickly become a favorite presenter of family
          programs at San Francisco Public Library."  _—Family Engagement
          Services, San Francisco Public Library_


          "The program was excellent. It definitely broadened their perception
          of cultures. The students enjoyed the ingenious way the actors changed
          their parts. The kids went around mimicking the actors for days."
          _—Teacher, Hawes

          Elementary_


          "I’m so happy these kids are getting such wonderful exposure to Middle
          Eastern culture, and especially getting to hear the Palestinian voice.
          And to end it with one of my family’s favorite Fairuz songs was the
          cherry on top!" _—Parent, Berkwood Hedge School_


          "\[As an educator, I valued] an opportunity for students to experience
          art especially made by people of color and performers. _—Teacher,
          Cesar Chavez Elementary School_


          "Inspirational. It would be wonderful to bring it to all elementary
          schools." _—President, Berkeley PTA Council_


          "I so appreciated how this performance gave my students some
          understanding of Palestine, Arabic, and even the simple geography of
          the Middle East. I especially appreciated the lesson plan that was
          available to us before the performance." _—Teacher, Berkwood Hedge
          School_
