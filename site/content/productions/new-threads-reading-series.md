  New Threads is Golden Threadâ€™s annual staged reading series that engages its
  audience in the process of playmaking and allows writers of Middle Eastern and
  non-Middle Eastern descent an authentic and supportive space to develop work
  about the Middle East. Since its launch in 2011, many New Threads plays and
  playwrights have continued on to receive mainstage productions.

  The readings are accompanied by talkbacks with the artists and experts that
  comment on the themes of the play. We invite you to join the creative process
  of a new play and discover brilliant gems never before seen in the Bay Area.
  We invite you to laugh, cry, and think alongside these beautiful stories from
  and about the Middle East. Each play is teeming with unexpected humor,
  surprising characters, and important questions about the world we live in
  today.
