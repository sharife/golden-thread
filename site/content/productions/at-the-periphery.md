  Set in Istanbul and Paris, **AT THE PERIPHERY** is a new play that focuses on
  the rarely told stories of migrants in Istanbul’s urban slums. Farmers Dilcha
  and Bilo leave their home in the countryside to make a life in the big city.
  Young lovers Azad and Tamar appeal to superstar Sultane’s reality TV show to
  realize their dream of a life in France. Gyspy woman Kybelee finds home in a
  shack she has made with her own hands.


  Sedef Ecer’s new play takes a lyrical, funny, and deeply human look at hope
  and home against all odds. Furthermore, the play examines homelessness and
  displacement in Istanbul with an expansive global lens that brings it home to
  the San Francisco Bay Area where these issues are extremely palpable and
  relevant. 


  Translated from Turkish by Evren Odcikin, this production marks both At the
  Periphery's US premiere as well as the first co-production between Golden
  Thread Productions and [Crowded Fire Theater](crowdedfire.org). For more
