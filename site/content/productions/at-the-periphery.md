Set in Istanbul and Paris, **AT THE PERIPHERY** is a new play that focuses on the rarely told stories of migrants in Istanbul’s urban slums. Farmers Dilcha and Bilo leave their home in the countryside to make a life in the big city. Young lovers Azad and Tamar appeal to superstar Sultane’s reality TV show to realize their dream of a life in France. Gyspy woman Kybelee finds home in a shack she has made with her own hands. Sedef Ecer’s new play takes a lyrical, funny, and deeply human look at hope and home against all odds.
