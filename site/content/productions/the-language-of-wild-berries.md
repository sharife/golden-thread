  Donya and Davood celebrate their wedding anniversary by traveling to the same
  sea side town where they spent their honeymoon. But on this trip, their 10th
  anniversary, a mysterious young man is following them. Who is he? What does he
  want? Trying to solve the mystery of the young man throws Donya and Davood
  into a time warp recalling their past nine anniversary trips. They remember
  what they have forgotten. But will that be enough to save their marriage?
  Award-winning Iranian playwright, Naghmeh Samini finds the sublime in an
  ordinary couple’s annual road trips to the Caspian Sea. This U.S. Premiere is
  Samini’s first production in English in the United States.
