<p>We believe that immersing yourself in someone else’s experience is the best way to appreciate their point of view.  Therefore, every play serves as an invitation to discover unexpected connections and engage in deeply moving conversations that last well beyond the life of the play.</p>
<p>Our programs expose non-Middle Eastern audiences to the authentic voices and alternative perspectives of the region, while serving Middle Eastern audiences who rarely encounter meaningful reflections of their own culture in the performing arts. </p>
<p>Our Guiding Principles are to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Develop and produce innovative works that intrigue, inquire, and influence.</li>
<li>Engage the community in an active dialogue and draw diverse audiences.</li>
<li>Discover, develop, and support Middle Eastern artists.</li>
<li>Promote the rich texts and diverse performance styles of the Middle East.</li>
<li>Seek and include the many talents of our diverse communities in the production of socially conscious works with a progressive political sensibility.</li>
</ul>
<p>In our vast imagination, the Middle East is defined not by geographical boundaries and political separations, but as the shared experience of the people, who throughout history have been touched by its stories and culture. As such, Golden Thread’s work is borderless and serves to reorient the United States-Middle East relationship.</p>

<h3><strong>The Basics</strong></h3>
<p>We define “Middle East” and &#8220;Middle Eastern&#8221; broadly and inclusively, and embrace the multiplicity of ethnic and religious identities that span Southwest Asia, North Africa, Central Asia, the Caucasus, parts of Mediterranean Europe, and our Diaspora communities. We understand our respective backgrounds in terms of rich pluralism and interconnectedness. We also define “America” and “American” in the broadest possible ways to include the continents of North and South America.</p>
<p>Furthermore, at this time in history, it’s important that we include American Muslims, of all cultural, ethnic, and racial backgrounds, as members of our Middle Eastern American communities.</p>
