# **Who Doesn't Love a Good Puzzle?**


**by Wesley Apfel, Production Stage Manager**

As an audience member, I enjoy my share of thought-provoking theatre. And as a theatre professional, I love a good puzzle to figure out. This is my second year as the Production Stage Manager of ReOrient, and while I’ve done some festivals before, nothing could quite prepare me for the unique challenges of rehearsing so many short plays simultaneously. It’s quite the puzzle indeed!

The first job of the stage manager is to create the schedule. Usually when you start to plan the rehearsal process for a play… you talk to the director, gather availability from the cast, and begin to lay out your calendar. This year’s ReOrient has a company of 11 actors, performing in eight plays, with five directors at the helm. When it’s all said and done, the plays will be divided into two Series, performing in repertory on different nights. On top of that, our freelance artists all have busy schedules in which rehearsals may need to fit around classes, work, performances, and other commitments.  I’ve got some super spreadsheets and at least 18 different calendars to help keep it all straight. It took around two months to compile and sort for ReOrient 2015, and at the end, we came up with a rehearsal schedule that looks something like this:

The rehearsal period for ReOrient, before the first audience, is only 3 short weeks, which means that we need to make the most of every hour. Not every actor is in every play, which allows us to have two to three rehearsal rooms going at once. While rehearsals are simultaneous, very few of them back right up to one another—and that was done on purpose! Having an extended break for actors and directors to gather their things, make notes, and transition (both physically and mentally) into their next rehearsal block worked well in keeping everyone fresh and focused amongst all the other activity. Meetings pop up in the conference area and costume fittings in the dressing room.  Actors hang out grabbing coffee, memorizing their lines or reading the plays they’re not in. Directors talk new ideas with designers. It’s a hive of activity from the first day to the last.  
 
There’s an old adage that I take to heart when approaching any project: “an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.” At the ReOrient Festival, a solid plan and good preparation—not to mention a touch of inspiration—allow it all to roll out as smoothly as possible. ReOrient 2015 is already proving to be a great adventure!

We can say without a doubt that we’ve never met anyone who likes scheduling more than Wes! This is his third time working with Golden Thread. Previously, he worked on Night Over Erzinga and the 2012 ReOrient Festival. Fun fact: He is the only stage manager since the launch of the festival to return to stage manage ReOrient again!
