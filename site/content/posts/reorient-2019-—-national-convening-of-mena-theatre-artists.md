_**Building on years of community organizing, the convening, hosted by Golden Thread, will launch a national coalition of Middle Eastern, North African and Muslim theater artists.**_ 

Golden Thread is part of a 14-member steering committee that has been working to increase MENA visibility, amplify our voices, and deepen the impact of our work. This gathering is made up of work sessions as well as public panels, roundtables, and coalition-building opportunities in conjunction with Golden Thread's ReOrient Festival. 

Come be part of our conversation on leading and fostering Middle Eastern and North African narratives on the American stage!

All events are open to the public unless otherwise specified as a MENA-only work session. Snacks and refreshments will be provided throughout the convening. Admission is free; advanced registration is strongly encouraged.
