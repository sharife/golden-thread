The Civil Rights Movement reached its height in 1963 when Martin Luther King, Jr. led 250,000 at the March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28. On September 15, the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham—used as a meeting place by Civil Rights leaders—was bombed by reported members of the Ku Klux Klan, resulting in the death of four black girls aged 11 to 14. To counter the images of dissent broadcast around the world, the Kennedy Administration continued its U.S. State Department Tours, sending popular Jazz musicians abroad as goodwill ambassadors. <!-- more -->For the fall of 1963, the U.S. chose Duke Ellington. _“Carefully designed to gain support for established foreign policy objectives relating to the particular country [visited],”_ the Duke Ellington Orchestra was sent on a three-month tour to the Middle East and South Asia. The band encountered a changing Middle East that was negotiating Western notions of modernization.

The character of Ray Hamilton is inspired by several Ellington musicians and their experiences on the tour. In Iran, the Ellington Orchestra performed in Tehran, Isfahan and Abadan, and held workshops at universities. Their concert in Tehran was broadcast live on Television Iran and lasted far longer than scheduled. In Iraq, the band arrived in the midst of a coup but despite city-wide curfews, _“the Ellington concerts turned people away nightly.”_ Ellington made light of the political turmoil, _“calling Baghdad a ‘swinging town’ and threatening to write a new composition called ‘Baghdad Bump or Boom or Bounce, or something like that.’”_ The tour was cut short in Turkey when President Kennedy was assassinated on November 22. The Far East Suite album (1967), including the song “Isfahan,” arose from the sights and sounds the Ellington Orchestra absorbed during this trip. **
