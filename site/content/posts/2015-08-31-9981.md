# **How to Resist With Theatre**


**by Nora el Samahy, Actor**

In Yussef El Guindi’s play, _Picking up the Scent_, the character Hisham alludes to resisting against ‘the tyrants’ through doing what he loves, archaeology, while his wife Nisrin does so through poetry. Needless to say, many of us from the Middle East have been at a loss of how to resist over the last five years, whether we’re there or here: far away with an ache of how to connect, react, feel, and take action. Years ago, after fancying myself a revolutionary at 17, I realized that my action cannot be as forward or necessarily courageous as a front-line combatant. This is where theatre steps in and why doing new work like the collection of pieces pulled together in ReOrient is so very appealing.

This is the third time I’ve been involved in ReOrient and I always marvel at the sheer logistical footwork needed to execute a project with this many moving parts. The opportunity to convene with a bevy of talented people required for the creation of such an event is truly marvelous. It also feels like home: full, vibrant, and unpredictable. These are attributes that I highly value and wake up to with glee. What has been wonderful to witness as a participant of ReOrient is its evolution over the last decade. There are not only many more short plays to select from, but also more Middle-Eastern American actors, and the company has grown to a mature and organized entity. The dedication to that process of establishment is evident in the material and organization of this year’s festival.

Over the July 4th weekend, there was a ReOrient Camp that gathered the majority of the team involved in this year’s festival. It was much like being at a family reunion, where you see extended family that you are so fond of but rarely get to see. Of course, there are many new players, who are equally as engaging and interesting. There were, as no surprise, rich conversations as the plays cover a wide range of deep, humorous, and challenging subjects that make us investigate humanity. 

Being human in this day and age is a puzzling proposition. There are moments where we exhibit such questionable behavior and others where we mesmerize each other. Theatre is a medium where the human condition can be examined, played with, and questioned together. That is why I ReOrient.

She has appeared in numerous Golden Thread Productions like _ECSTASY | a waterfable_, and two previous ReOrient Festivals. She is in two plays in this year’s festival: _Bitterenders_ by Hannah Khalil and _Picking Up the Scent_ by Yussef El Guindi. One fun fact is that she was also in a Yussef El Guindi play last ReOrient Festival—that one was a monologue about a grieving mother called _Birds Flew In_.
