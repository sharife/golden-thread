# **NEW VIDEO: Vida Ghahremani inspires and empowers**

[![Vida Ghahremani Stars in Isfahan Blues](/img/archive/2015/04/VidaFeature_Web.jpg)](https://youtu.be/FV8LspJJK8s) *"What Vida did was no small feat for a woman in '63,"* director **Laura Hope** explains, *"She's such a role model for us, to be true to who you are...and insist that our stories be told!"*

**[In a brand new video interview](https://youtu.be/FV8LspJJK8s)**, we sat down with members of the *Isfahan Blues* creative team to discuss the life and legacy of **Vida Ghahremani**, one of the most prolific Iranian film stars of the 1950s and 60s.

Not only is Vida the inspiration behind our production, but she also stars in the show. Dramaturg **Nakissa Etemad**, director **Laura Hope**, and playwright **Torange Yeghiazarian**, who is Vida's daughter, discuss what it's like to share this experience with her on stage and off.
