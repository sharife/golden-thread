# **Making the Middle East Personal**


**by Lawrence Radecker, Actor**

ReOrient is a joy for me. I get to work with some of the most talented artists in the Bay Area, plus I get to study a different culture with each show. I participated in my first Reorient in 2003, which was an all-encompassing learning experience. I played an Israeli dad in one piece and a white racist security guard in another. The Israeli dad character had to deal with his soldier son losing his sanity after killing a young Palestinian boy at a border crossing. The talkbacks were superb. One night during the talkback, a former Israeli soldier and a Palestinian debated the conflict between the two countries right there in the theater. The cast, the director, and the dramaturg just sat there, listened, and learned. We didn't have to say anything because the play opened up this dialogue. I realized at that moment that Golden Thread was a different kind of theatre company and I wanted to do more ReOrienting.

My experience with Golden Thread is unique because I'm a white actor, who is ethnically-ambiguous. I'm very aware that I'm usually outside of the culture I'm portraying, and this awareness makes me dig deeper. I ask a lot of questions and, ultimately. I try to find my connection to the characters through the relationships in the story rather than through the actual cultural experiences. This process has opened up the Middle East to me in a concrete way. For example, by talking to individuals, who have lived through it, the Israeli/Palestinian conflict became very personal. I spoke to a Palestinian woman, who described waiting in line for hours at the border to enter Israel and then was turned away. I talked to an Israeli man who fought in one of the numerous Israeli/Palestinian wars. The Armenian genocide was completely off my radar. I had heard some stories here and there, but in the process of preparing to do an Armenian character I learned about the genocide deniers in Turkey. I also spoke with an Armenian, who told me that she wouldn't step into a business run by Turkish people. I was floored by this, because this woman was younger than me, and yet her passion was deep and had endured through multiple generations. Once again, it became personal. 

I'm looking forward to my 2015 Golden Thread education. My pencils are sharpened, my scripts are highlighted, and my mind and heart are open. I'm ready. Let's ReOrient!
