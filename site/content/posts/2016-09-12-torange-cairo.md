[Cairo International Festival for Contemporary and Experimental Theater](http://www.cifcet.gov.eg/) was founded in 1988 as Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theater. After it concluded its 22nd edition in 2010, it was adjourned in 2011 until 2015. It is back this year, with a new term added to its title: “Contemporary” has been introduced to the title with the hope that it would open up the scope for a wider range of participation and varied production-styles for a broader audience. Moreover, the festival returns without one of its former guidelines: The Contest. It returns as a theatrical panorama aiming to encompass contemporary and unique international experiments. It returns with the understanding that it is collaboration, exchange, conversation -- not awards -- that should be the aim of all major international festivals.
