Golden Thread Productions has engaged more than 50,000 audience members in the Bay Area over the course of two decades, providing a rare platform where Middle Eastern and non-Middle Eastern artists and audiences can interact and reflect on charged topical issues. Managing Director Michelle Mulholland remarks, “I’ve always appreciated Golden Thread’s ability to bring people together. Whether you are Middle Eastern or not, the work is accessible and there is a place for you in the conversation.”

Founded in San Francisco in 1996, Golden Thread is the first American theatre company focused on the Middle East. The pioneering efforts of Golden Thread, along with Silk Road Rising in Chicago and New York-based Noor Theatre and Nibras Arab-American Theater Collective, have contributed to the current visibility and prominence of Middle Eastern American theatre in the United States. Under Founding Artistic Director Torange Yeghiazarian’s stewardship it has become a growing force among the new voices of the American theatre – one that the mainstream can no longer ignore.

As a South Asian artist with a passion for aesthetic border-crossings, my opportunity to collaborate as a dramaturg on ReOrient Festival is invaluable. South Asian American and Middle Eastern American artists and communities share many similar stories, cultures, and histories as immigrants. The current climate of xenophobia makes the need to forge artistic bridges even more compelling. 

Golden Thread began its ReOrient Festival of Short Plays and Forum shortly after its founding “to present alternative perspectives of the Middle East and to showcase the multiplicity of stories, voices and styles from the region.”  It has since evolved into Golden Thread’s signature program, attracting artists from across the world. In the charged political context of this past year, ReOrient 2017 Festival promises to be more engaging and relevant than ever before.

## **ReOrient 2017: A Sneak Peek**

As one of three Publications Dramaturgs for ReOrient, I am attending the first company read-through on October 24th of the seven plays in ReOrient 2017. The buzz is palpable as introductions are made among a large company of 38 artists consisting of producers, actors, directors, designers, playwrights, stage managers, and a dramaturgy team. It takes a village to put on a festival as ambitious as ReOrient!

In this first rehearsal, a vital context is being declared by the festival’s producers to fuel the intense creative process of the coming weeks.

Photo by Nakissa Etemad.[/caption]Torange Yeghiazarian relays the genesis of the festival: “Why do we ReOrient? As a small theatre company that produces only one or two mainstage productions a year, there was no way for us to really reflect the diversity of the Middle East… cultural, religious, linguistic, but also artistic, aesthetic diversity. That’s always been an important part of ReOrient…. We started the festival [in 1999] so that we could do one program to showcase that diversity.” She invites spirited intellectual engagement from the artists present. “The art of conversation and meaningful exchange [for common understanding] has been lost,” she adds. “I look to you to provide it, and to challenge each other to learn more and question your own assumptions.” She urges them to dig deep into the plays and investigate ideas with a spirit of curiosity. With these words, she hands over the conversation to Evren Odcikin, who is producing this year’s festival.

Evren suggests artists bring their _whole_ selves and their complicated relationships to the Middle East to the table. “Nothing is off limits. Don’t assume things about people. Go at it for 3 weeks. Tell us if something is missing in the room. Be nice to other company members.” He explains that Golden Thread’s motto is “Art. Activism. Family.” and in that order. 

The family of artists is energized by this rehearsal, inspired to launch into the upcoming work.



## **The Players

**Board President Farah Jahan Siddiqui Bullara explains, “In a slight departure from ReOrient 2015, the style and tone of the plays [this year] is much more diverse. ReOrient 2017 will offer a mezze for all tastes: comedy, tragedy, contemporary, traditional [theatre] and even sound installation.”

ReOrient 2017 showcases 7 playwrights selected by an eminent theatre panel from 79 submissions and 14 countries, including three local women playwrights: Betty Shamieh, E.H. Benedict, and Torange Yeghiazarian. 

The festival puts on one stage stories and playwrights from Armenia, Iraq, Iran, Japan, Lebanon, Palestine, Syria, Tunisia, Turkey, United Kingdom and the U.S. – a singular theatre-going experience for Bay Area audiences.

Kate Boyd’s set design consists of “a floating wall of doors” to reflect themes of crossing borders and to serve as a metaphor for the welcoming and the shutting out of other cultures. Doors transform into airport scanners, beds, closets, entrances and exits. Costume Designer Brooke Jennings showcases individual characters while highlighting the overall festival aesthetic. Lighting Designer Cassie Barnes brings her painterly and artistic approach, and James Ard connects six plays with his evocative sound design. For the seventh, James co-adapts _Shelter_ with Torange Yeghiazarian into a soundscape for the stage.

Managing Director Michelle Mulholland points out, “The ReOrient process is ongoing in the 2-year cycle. We are always taking submissions, reading plays, casting, conducting development camps, rehearsing or producing at any given time. Once the team is assembled, and it takes a big team, the ReOrient process is the same as a general production, except the process of creation requires much more cooperation. We all have to collaborate to create a cohesive experience.”



## **Partnership with LMDA

**This year's ReOrient Festival marks a unique collaboration between Golden Thread and the Literary Managers and Dramaturgs of the Americas (LMDA). This partnership connects for the first time two organizations who value cultural exchange, provocative programming and dialogue, a multiplicity of perspectives, and in-depth artistic development and research. LMDA’s website states: _“LMDA holds the belief that theater is a vital art form that has the power to nourish, educate, and transform individuals and their communities and that dramaturgy is central to the process of theater-making.”_

LMDA's Regional Vice President of Metro Bay Area Nakissa Etemad is curator for the partnership and serves as lead dramaturg for the festival with a team of Production Dramaturgs and Publications Dramaturgs.

Photo by Nakissa Etemad.[/caption]It is a welcome challenge for dramaturgs to excavate substantial cultural context and to provide dramaturgy for Middle Eastern American plays and their audiences. The match between dramaturgs and Middle Eastern theatre writers is apt and palpable, as both fields are a relatively recent phenomenon in this country and can greatly benefit from artistic collaboration. ReOrient is fortunate to have seasoned Iranian American dramaturg Nakissa Etemad to lead a team of dramaturgs from a variety of backgrounds to fill the gaps in cultural knowledge and provide essential creative support in play development through dramaturgy.

In addition, the ReOrient dramaturgs have gathered vital research and created fact sheets about the plays called _Notes & Context_, which include enriching background information, such as geographical maps for the setting of plays, the play’s origins, characters and style, reference articles and statistics. Nakissa’s dramaturgical notes and article packets on Betty Shamieh’s _Make No Mistake_ contain an insider’s look into the playwright’s inspirations and a wealth of knowledge about Amal-Al-Sadah, the youngest wife of Osama bin Laden who is the inspiration for the character of Amal. Emily DeDakis’ dramaturgical notes on Hannah Khalil’s _The Rehearsal_ reveal the play was inspired by post-Revolution censorship of theatre in Egypt and the story of the remarkable couple who co-founded Belarus Free Theatre in opposition to a regime that raids performances and imprisons artists.

The partnership is providing three Publications Dramaturgs for ReOrient who each compose a feature article (the first of which you are reading now) on a ReOrient topic for audiences and members of both organizations to cross-promote, advocate, educate, and inspire audiences and members about this special festival and company, and the field of dramaturgy. Dramaturgs provide the resources to contextualize and deepen the understanding of ReOrient’s plays for artists and audiences.

## **The Work Continues

**Golden Thread Productions has succeeded in making Middle Eastern theatre integral to the American stage, and is a vital component in the Bay Area theatre tapestry. There appears to be a noticeable divide between mainstream theatre companies and smaller culturally-specific theatres in the Bay Area. However, Golden Thread bridges the gap and continues to thrive because of its passionate leadership, artistry, and fierce advocacy for Middle Eastern theatre artists. It is a small company with a big vision that is changing the national dialogue around cultural inclusion in the performing arts. Torange Yeghiazarian and Founding Artistic Director Jamil Khoury of Silk Road Rising, a theatre company which focuses on Asian/Middle Eastern American stories, co-wrote ["Middle Eastern Artists Bill of Rights" and "Dear Producers, An Open Letter"](http://www.americantheatre.org/2017/09/29/middle-eastern-american-theatre-on-our-terms/) which was recently published in American Theatre magazine with the goal of elevating the conversation around inclusion of Middle Eastern voices on the American stage.

Board President Farah Bullara proclaims: “Golden Thread's work is important to me personally because I feel called to defend these artists and their work in an America that has become less tolerant of diversity and plurality. […] I feel as if Golden Thread's very survival is an act of resistance. Because we live in an increasingly divided America, there is a fierce urgency to the work that we do.” 

Get ready to ReOrient.
