**Free event features a reading of excerpts and a conversation with the artists.**

Join us for this reading of excerpts from our upcoming production of [_**Our Enemies: Lively Scenes of Love and Combat**_](https://www.goldenthread.org/2016-Season/Our-Enemies/) by Yussef El Guindi. The reading will be followed by a conversation with director Torange Yeghiazarian about representation of Arab-American writers and stories in mainstream media.

Saturday, October 8, at 4:30pm
Falafel Hut (1145 4th Street, San Rafael, CA 94901)
 
**About _Our Enemies_:**
Struggling writer Gamal hates the way his fellow Arab-Americans represent their culture on American media. Itâ€™s easy enough to take out his frustration on literature superstar Mohsen and local mosque leader, Sheikh Alfani. But when his own girlfriend and novelist Noor gets an offer from a major publisher backed with a national media campaign, how will Gamal manage his frustration?
