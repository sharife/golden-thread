Eager to establish Iran as a political leader and economic powerhouse, the Shah of Iran Mohammad Reza Pahlavi (ruler from 1941-1979) led the nation towards industrialization and social reform modeled after Western democracies. A U.S.-led coup in 1953 re-established the Shah, and in 1963 Iran was considered America’s main ally in the region. Iran’s young film industry reflected the nation’s desire for modernization and freedom.

Copying popular American and European films of the era, the plot lines defined beauty, desire, and success according to Western ideals; Iranian traditions were either romanticized or ridiculed.

The character of Bella is based on Vida Ghahremani, a film star who made her mark as one of the leading ladies of Iranian Cinema from 1955-65. She appeared in 17 Iranian films, all in 35mm, black & white, the industry standard in Iran at that time. Many of Vida’s films were romances or melodramas, plus crime thrillers by Khachikian and comedies, dominated by female leads who outnumbered male film stars in this era. Redefining the Iranian woman was at the heart of the Pahlavi regime’s social reform; the Shah’s father had banned women from veiling in 1935. Cinema was central to promoting the image of the Westernized Iranian woman. So it came as no surprise when women’s rights, specifically veiling, and cinema were targeted by Khomeini’s regime when it toppled the Pahlavi reign in 1979.
