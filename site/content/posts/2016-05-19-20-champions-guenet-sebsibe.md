**What was your first experience with Golden Thread and when?**
I first experienced Golden Thread when I attended a performance of _22 Minutes Remaining_ by Oakland playwright Ignacio Zulueta during ReOrient 2007-08. It was such a powerful story that I still think about it to this day.

**Why do you need Golden Thread?**
I return to Golden Thread time and time again to keep myself updated on real issues happening in the Middle East, of everyday lives, struggles, joys, and creativity. I need Golden Thread because it reminds me of the amazing resilience of the human spirit!

**What was your strangest, oddest, funniest Golden Thread experience?**
I have seen more than a dozen plays on the Golden Thread stage and my strangest and most meaningful experience came out of Yussef El Guindi’s _The Monologist Suffers Her Monologue_ in ReOrient 2009: I invited a very pro-Israeli friend to the play because I didn’t know how to honestly express my sentiments of the unfair balance of power regarding Palestine to her. Luckily she was open to learning about the ‘Palestinian state of mind’ through the monologue beautifully performed by Golden Thread’s Sara Razavi.

**Describe Golden Thread in 20 words (no cheating). **
_Truly enjoyable storytelling concepts, pace, and angles of morality reflected, that resonate with many of us from old world cultures._
