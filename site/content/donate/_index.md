# <center>Your support gives us hope for the future.</center>

The COVID virus is impacting each of us in different ways. During these precarious times, we may find ourselves in need one moment and able to help someone else in the next. 

Dealing with a pandemic is many things, but perhaps mostly it is a reminder that all humans are interconnected. This has long been our philosophy at Golden Thread. We are compelled to share stories from or about the Middle East because we believe every audience will find a reflection of their own experience somewhere in that story. These reflections show, we are not alone.

Like all of us, Golden Thread is facing great uncertainty. You probably already know that half of our season has been cancelled. This includes the US Premiere of *On the Periphery*, which closed 3.5 weeks early, our annual women's day event *What do the Women Say?*, our second main stage show of the season, *Jogging*, a touring show from Lebanon slated for May, and the full spring school and library tour of Fairytale Players.

We are doing everything we can to mitigate these losses. We have applied for relief funding with the Small Business Association, the city of San Francisco, and the National Endowment for the Arts. And we are grateful for additional support received from our generous Board of Trustees and recent funders.

We’re committed to surviving this crisis, maintaining our essential staff and basic operations, and returning to our regular programming as soon as possible. If you are in a position to contribute, we would be most grateful. With your help, Golden Thread will endure as a vital hub of artistic activism, deep dialogue and thriving community.
