      <description>Michael Malek Najjar interviews the Our Enemies playwright Yussef El Guindi.
What does the title “Arab American” mean to you as a playwright? How does that identity manifest itself in your work?
The “New World” has a tendency to want to identify the origins of the immigrants who come to its shores. There appears to be two contradictory impulses: one is, Forget where you come from and become an American (with all the implicit values that come with that homogenizing label); the other is to ask, “But where do you come from?</description>

It might still be covered in boxes, but we couldn&amp;rsquo;t be happier in our new home! After years of being cramped in tiny offices and having to scramble to find rehearsal space, we are finally settling into a space that accommodates both our administrative and rehearsal needs. This move takes us one giant step closer to our goal of a long-term artistic home.</description>

      <description>Resilience and Hope in Afghanistan by Torange Yeghizarian
Most people think of the Taliban or Osama Bin Laden when they hear Afghanistan mentioned. But this landlocked country of 32 million has been thriving since 2nd century AD. The beginning of modern Afghanistan can be dated to 1747, when Ahmad Khan Abdali was elected king of the Afghans in a tribal assembly in Kandahar. Because of its strategic location, Afghanistan has always been of interest to foreign powers, but its terrain is so rugged that no military campaign, dating back to Alexander the Great and the Soviet Russians has succeeded in fully subduing its population.</description>

When we moved into a new apartment, I was afraid to let the cat out. “WHAT IF HE GOES OUTSIDE BUT FEELS SAD AND REGRETS IT THEN CAN’T FIND HIS WAY HOME?” I cried to the internet. Apparently, it takes a cat three months to recalibrate their compass and sense of space, then they should be able to find their way back instinctually.</description>

Singing folk songs in Syria was a bridge that connected the past with the present, the young with the old, and all were welcomed to join in the circle and sing along.

      <description>Beginning a New Conversation About Iran by Sara Razavi, Director
Members of my family, like many Iranians, emigrated from Iran in waves. Some of our family left to study abroad before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and never returned. Some fled after the Islamic Revolution because of persecution. And some, like my immediate family, left because of “the War.” And one of the two plays I’m directing this year, Songs of Our Childhood by Nahal Navidar, is set in 1980 in an Iranian triage on the frontlines of the Iran-Iraq War.</description>

      <description>How to Resist With Theatre by Nora el Samahy, Actor
In Yussef El Guindi’s play, Picking up the Scent, the character Hisham alludes to resisting against ‘the tyrants’ through doing what he loves, archaeology, while his wife Nisrin does so through poetry. Needless to say, many of us from the Middle East have been at a loss of how to resist over the last five years, whether we’re there or here: far away with an ache of how to connect, react, feel, and take action.</description>

As an audience member, I enjoy my share of thought-provoking theatre. And as a theatre professional, I love a good puzzle to figure out. This is my second year as the Production Stage Manager of ReOrient, and while I’ve done some festivals before, nothing could quite prepare me for the unique challenges of rehearsing so many short plays simultaneously.</description>

Actors, directors, playwrights, designers, and production staff chat full of inspired ideas for the weeks to come. In many ways, this spirited encounter is not unlike the initial production meetings that take place in so many rehearsal spaces.</description>

ReOrient is a joy for me. I get to work with some of the most talented artists in the Bay Area, plus I get to study a different culture with each show. I participated in my first Reorient in 2003, which was an all-encompassing learning experience. I played an Israeli dad in one piece and a white racist security guard in another.</description>

      <description>Writing Beyond My Own Culture by Emma Goldman-Sherman, Playwright
My play, Counting in Sha’ab, about a community in Iraq, mostly wrote itself before I knew anything about Iraq. I adapted it from an article in the New York Times that immediately struck me and created an emotional response large enough to send me inside that world. I could see the canned goods on the shelves of the grocery store where the play is set.</description>

      <description>Ghost No More! by Playwright Yussef El Guindi
ReOrient is a big bundle of drama, comedy, lyricism, surreal somersaults into strange landscapes, or realistic lunges into sensitive topics (among other things). A ReOrient stage is a stage stuffed with unique viewpoints and unconventional ideas that come from a much misunderstood, and frequently maligned, part of the world. I’ve always been a tad gobsmacked that, given the Middle East’s prominence in world affairs, larger theaters, for the most part, stay away from plays that want to probe the culture and politics of that region.</description>

On September 15, the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham—used as a meeting place by Civil Rights leaders—was bombed by reported members of the Ku Klux Klan, resulting in the death of four black girls aged 11 to 14.</description>
