Murrey got to know Golden Thread when they were a tenant of Z Space, where she served on the board for 11 years; and got to know them more intimately when she provided fundraising consulting services to the organization in 2014.  She has served on three theatre boards, and is currently serving on the board of Sojourn, the multi-faith volunteer chaplaincy at Zuckerberg San Francisco General Hospital.  She is also on the Vestry of Trinity Saint Peters Episcopal Church and is the Chair of the Phillips Academy (Andover) Northern California Regional Alumni Association.

This is largely due to the talented folks at the SF Mime Troupe, where Runk is the resident Production Stage Manager, but mostly due to rent control! Runk has also stage managed with the Magic Theatre, SF Shakespeare Festival, Intersection for the Arts, Word For Word, African-American Shakespeare Company, and, of course, Golden Thread Productions! Runk is excited and honored to have found a second home away from home with Golden Thread’s Resident Artists program.</p>
