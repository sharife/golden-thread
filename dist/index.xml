The companies have amassed a combined 44 years of history, in part by investing in strategic partnerships that are instrumental in creating a more sustainable existence rooted in San Francisco.</description>

      <description>Reviews HIGHEST RATING!
&amp;#8220;Smart, daring and well constructed&amp;#8230; For a play about ideas, the kind of urgent ideas that don’t make it to American stages often enough, its debaters are just as complex and fleshed out as the ideas themselves.&amp;#8221; —San Francisco Chronicle (read full review)
&amp;#8220;Powerful, unforgettable theatre&amp;#8230; There’s sex, deep rumination, harsh conflict, galvanizing anger, violence, manipulation, lying, fierce intelligence, incisive criticism and genuine affection.

      <description>Michael Malek Najjar interviews the Our Enemies playwright Yussef El Guindi.
What does the title “Arab American” mean to you as a playwright? How does that identity manifest itself in your work?
The “New World” has a tendency to want to identify the origins of the immigrants who come to its shores. There appears to be two contradictory impulses: one is, Forget where you come from and become an American (with all the implicit values that come with that homogenizing label); the other is to ask, “But where do you come from?</description>

      <description>Termeh Yeghiazarian, a visual artist, is one of the co-founders of Golden Thread. She was an essential part of the discussions that led to Golden Thread’s inclusive and groundbreaking vision of Middle Eastern-American theatre. She is also Torange Yeghiazarian’s sister, and artistic talent and disregard to instructions must run in the Yeghiazarian family, as Termeh answered our questions with a freeform blog. We’re so very excited to include her voice in this celebration of 20 years.</description>

      <description>Sara Razavi was a very obvious choice to include as one of our 20 Champions. What has Sara not done for Golden Thread? She’s been on our stages (most memorably in Yussef El Guindi’s The Monologist Suffers Her Monologue), directed numerous plays for the ReOrient, served on our Board of Trustees, including as president of the board (2011-2013). We are very lucky to have her as part of the Golden Thread family.</description>

Walid Azad is a member of the production team of The Most Dangerous Highway in the World and has been an invaluable resource to the cast and the creative team. Like many Afghans living in the Bay Area, Walid Azad left Afghanistan in the 1980’s. He had to cross the border to Pakistan illegally and on foot then wait in Pakistan for months until his brother who was already living in the Bay Area would secure a visa for him.</description>

      <description>Resilience and Hope in Afghanistan by Torange Yeghizarian
Most people think of the Taliban or Osama Bin Laden when they hear Afghanistan mentioned. But this landlocked country of 32 million has been thriving since 2nd century AD. The beginning of modern Afghanistan can be dated to 1747, when Ahmad Khan Abdali was elected king of the Afghans in a tribal assembly in Kandahar. Because of its strategic location, Afghanistan has always been of interest to foreign powers, but its terrain is so rugged that no military campaign, dating back to Alexander the Great and the Soviet Russians has succeeded in fully subduing its population.</description>

      <description>Re-calibration and Re-orientation by Kamee Abrahamian Co-Chair, &amp;ldquo;Orientations&amp;rdquo; panel on Saturday, October 3, at 5pm in ReOrient Forum 2015
When we moved into a new apartment, I was afraid to let the cat out. “WHAT IF HE GOES OUTSIDE BUT FEELS SAD AND REGRETS IT THEN CAN’T FIND HIS WAY HOME?” I cried to the internet. Apparently, it takes a cat three months to recalibrate their compass and sense of space, then they should be able to find their way back instinctually.</description>

Singing folk songs in Syria was a bridge that connected the past with the present, the young with the old, and all were welcomed to join in the circle and sing along. The same songs were always sung, played in the car, bus, or circle of chairs out in the farm or village under the starry sky.</description>

      <description>Beginning a New Conversation About Iran by Sara Razavi, Director
Members of my family, like many Iranians, emigrated from Iran in waves. Some of our family left to study abroad before the 1979 Islamic Revolution, and never returned. Some fled after the Islamic Revolution because of persecution. And some, like my immediate family, left because of “the War.” And one of the two plays I’m directing this year, Songs of Our Childhood by Nahal Navidar, is set in 1980 in an Iranian triage on the frontlines of the Iran-Iraq War.</description>

      <description>How to Resist With Theatre by Nora el Samahy, Actor
In Yussef El Guindi’s play, Picking up the Scent, the character Hisham alludes to resisting against ‘the tyrants’ through doing what he loves, archaeology, while his wife Nisrin does so through poetry. Needless to say, many of us from the Middle East have been at a loss of how to resist over the last five years, whether we’re there or here: far away with an ache of how to connect, react, feel, and take action.</description>

As an audience member, I enjoy my share of thought-provoking theatre. And as a theatre professional, I love a good puzzle to figure out. This is my second year as the Production Stage Manager of ReOrient, and while I’ve done some festivals before, nothing could quite prepare me for the unique challenges of rehearsing so many short plays simultaneously.</description>

A visceral energy of excitement is palpable as I walk into the rehearsal space for Golden Thread’s ReOrient meet and greet. Actors, directors, playwrights, designers, and production staff chat full of inspired ideas for the weeks to come. In many ways, this spirited encounter is not unlike the initial production meetings that take place in so many rehearsal spaces.</description>

ReOrient is a joy for me. I get to work with some of the most talented artists in the Bay Area, plus I get to study a different culture with each show. I participated in my first Reorient in 2003, which was an all-encompassing learning experience. I played an Israeli dad in one piece and a white racist security guard in another.</description>

      <description>Writing Beyond My Own Culture by Emma Goldman-Sherman, Playwright
My play, Counting in Sha’ab, about a community in Iraq, mostly wrote itself before I knew anything about Iraq. I adapted it from an article in the New York Times that immediately struck me and created an emotional response large enough to send me inside that world. I could see the canned goods on the shelves of the grocery store where the play is set.</description>

      <description>Ghost No More! by Playwright Yussef El Guindi
ReOrient is a big bundle of drama, comedy, lyricism, surreal somersaults into strange landscapes, or realistic lunges into sensitive topics (among other things). A ReOrient stage is a stage stuffed with unique viewpoints and unconventional ideas that come from a much misunderstood, and frequently maligned, part of the world. I’ve always been a tad gobsmacked that, given the Middle East’s prominence in world affairs, larger theaters, for the most part, stay away from plays that want to probe the culture and politics of that region.</description>

On September 15, the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham—used as a meeting place by Civil Rights leaders—was bombed by reported members of the Ku Klux Klan, resulting in the death of four black girls aged 11 to 14.</description>
