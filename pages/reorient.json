ReOrient welcomes artists who challenge the dominant depictions of the Middle East and audiences who seek unconventional and provocative programming. It has served as a springboard for the careers of top Middle Eastern-American playwrights such as Yussef El Guindi and Betty Shamieh, and has introduced Bay Area audiences to significant and rarely-produced dramatic works from the Middle East by authors such as Sadegh Hedayat, Fatma Gallaire, and Tawfiq Al-Hakim. Alongside Middle Eastern voices, ReOrient also features the work of non-Middle Eastern playwrights, and has included premieres by distinguished American playwrights such as Naomi Wallace, Eric Ehn and Israel Horovitz.\n","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/programs/reorient/_index.md","sha":"f96601362db7b37a7337bae163ba179b5059e7ee"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2020-01-08T04:20:13.918Z","version":"1"}
