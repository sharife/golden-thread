It’s easy enough to take out his frustration on literature superstar Mohsen and local mosque leader, Sheikh Alfani. But when his own girlfriend and novelist Noor gets an offer from a major publisher backed with a national media campaign, how will Gamal manage his frustration?<br /><br />Award-winning Egyptian-American playwright Yussef El Guindi holds the honor of being the most produced writer at Golden Thread. El Guindi has won the Steinberg/American Theater Critics Association’s New Play Award in 2012, and was the recipient of the 2010 Middle East America Distinguished Playwright Award. His previous premieres with the company include <em>Language Rooms</em>, <em>Jihad Jones and the Kalashnikov Babes</em>, <em>Back of the Throat</em>, <em>Scenic Routes</em>, and many shorts in ReOrient Festivals. Golden Thread performed El Guindi’s <em>Karima’s City</em> at the Cairo International Festival for Experimental Theatre in 2004.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/productions/our-enemies.md","sha":"551e1af64de731247527798cef608f8f685a2e23"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-09-12T21:35:34.879Z"}
