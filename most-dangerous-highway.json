Soldiers, accidents, and ghosts are no match for this little fighter with a knack for surviving the toughest challenges. Inspired by a [New York Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/10/14/world/asia/afghan-boys-eke-living-amid-peril-at-gorge.html?_r=1) article about the real-life “Pepsi bottle boys” of Afghanistan, this poetic play introduces an up-and-coming writer of great promise.<br /><br />Kevin Artigue is a graduate of Public Theater’s prestigious Emerging Writers Group and the first playwright of non-Middle Eastern descent to be produced on the Golden Thread mainstage. He has been developing this play with Golden Thread for three years, including as part of the 2014 National New Play Network’s showcase.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/productions/most-dangerous-highway.md","sha":"64c136cfc4d252298f5052a947505b0f3db99526"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-09-12T18:36:40.498Z"}
