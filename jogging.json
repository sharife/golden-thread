As she jogs through both secluded and open spaces in Beirut, she revisits dreams, desires, hopes, disillusionments, characters, and roles. Her body is stimulated through exercise with two hormones, dopamine and adrenaline, alternating between destruction and construction. In Medea-like fashion, this cycle within Hanane — woman, wife and mother — echoes that of her city, one that destroys to build and builds to destroy.","objects":{"entry":{"path":"site/content/productions/jogging.md","sha":"b5bea13affd590eae66ec6fdcd1e4e9a367ac5b9"},"files":[]},"timeStamp":"2019-12-02T23:01:06.751Z"}
